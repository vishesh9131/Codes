| Content-Based Filtering    | Recommends items based on similarity of features or attributes | Scalable, personalized recommendations | Limited ability to introduce novel items, cold start problem |
| Collaborative Filtering   | Recommends items based on user preferences and behaviors     | Can introduce novel items, scalable      | Cold start problem, limited domain expertise |
| Matrix Factorization       | Decomposes user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional matrices | Handles sparse data, efficient recommendations | Requires computational resources for training |
| Neural Collaborative Filtering | Combines neural networks with matrix factorization       | Captures nonlinear relationships, improved recommendations | Requires large datasets, computational resources |
