## Introduction
VishGraphs is a Python library for graph visualization and analysis. It provides tools for generating random graphs, drawing graphs in 2D and 3D, and analyzing graph properties.

## Installation
To install VishGraphs, you can use pip:
```
pip install vishgraphs
```

## Usage
### Generating Random Graphs
To generate a random graph, you can use the `generate_random_graph` function:
```python
import vishgraphs

graph_file = vishgraphs.generate_random_graph(10, "random_graph.csv")
```

### Drawing Graphs
VishGraphs supports drawing graphs in both 2D and 3D:
```python
adj_matrix = vishgraphs.bipartite_matrix_maker(graph_file)
nodes = list(range(len(adj_matrix)))
top_nodes = [0, 1, 2]  # Example top nodes
vishgraphs.draw_graph(adj_matrix, nodes, top_nodes)
```

## Examples
### Example 1: Generating and Drawing a Random Graph
```python
import vishgraphs

graph_file = vishgraphs.generate_random_graph(10, "random_graph.csv")
adj_matrix = vishgraphs.bipartite_matrix_maker(graph_file)
nodes = list(range(len(adj_matrix)))
top_nodes = [0, 1, 2]  # Example top nodes
vishgraphs.draw_graph(adj_matrix, nodes, top_nodes)
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using VishGraphs, please check the documentation or open an issue on the GitHub repository.
