## 15 Visions for CoreRec :

1. **Graph-based Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Implement a graph-based GAN that generates new nodes or edges in the graph, allowing for the creation of new relationships and patterns.
2. **Graph Attention-based Recommendation**: Use graph attention mechanisms to focus on specific nodes or relationships when making recommendations, allowing for more accurate and personalized recommendations.
3. **Node Embedding-based Recommendation**: Use node embeddings, such as GraphSAGE or Graph Attention Networks, to learn dense representations of nodes and improve the recommendation accuracy.
4. **Graph-based Transfer Learning**: Implement a graph-based transfer learning approach that allows the model to learn from one graph and apply it to another, enabling the model to generalize to new graphs.
5. **Graph-based Meta-Learning**: Implement a graph-based meta-learning approach that allows the model to learn how to learn from new graphs, enabling the model to adapt to new graphs and tasks.
6. **Graph-based Explainable AI (XAI)**: Implement a graph-based XAI approach that provides explanations for the recommended nodes, such as the reasons why a particular node was chosen or the relevance of the node to the target node.
7. **Graph-based Adversarial Training**: Implement a graph-based adversarial training approach that trains the model to be robust against adversarial attacks, such as node or edge perturbations.
8. **Graph-based Transfer Learning with Adversarial Training**: Implement a graph-based transfer learning approach with adversarial training, allowing the model to learn from one graph and apply it to another while being robust against adversarial attacks.
9. **Graph-based Meta-Learning with Adversarial Training**: Implement a graph-based meta-learning approach with adversarial training, allowing the model to learn how to learn from new graphs and be robust against adversarial attacks.
